// Instructions:
//Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid,
// using newline chacrters to separate lines (\n)
//At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. 
//When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 
// change the program so that it works for any size, 
//outputting a grid of the given width and height.

* The making 

// we have to create 4 spaces and 4 hashtags interchangeable; 
// 8 X 8 (lines)
// looping twice 
// outer loop handles the lines 
// inner loop handles the character on line 

let getBits = " ";
let counter = "#"; 
let result = " "; 

for (let i = 0; i < number ; i++) {
let lines = number[i]; 
  for (let y = 0; y < number;y++){
     let info = space[y]; 
  }
  if (line %2 === 0){
   console.log (counter + getBits + (\n))
  } else {
   console.log (getBits + counter + (\n))
  }
}
